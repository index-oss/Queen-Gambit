# Multi-Stage Simulation Tool

## Overview
This project provides a **multi-stage system simulation framework** designed to demonstrate various
cybersecurity techniques in a controlled environment. It simulates multiple operational stages,
including process interaction, privilege checks, persistence mechanisms, network checks, and 
in-memory code execution â€” **without performing any harmful actions on your system**.

The tool is intended for **educational purposes**, allowing students and researchers to understand 
how complex operations are structured in a step-by-step workflow.

## Features
- **Process Interaction Simulation**  
  Simulates the concept of interacting with system processes for educational purposes.

- **Privilege Check Simulation**  
  Demonstrates how administrative privileges can be detected and how escalation concepts
  are applied.

- **Persistence Simulation**  
  Shows how a program can maintain continuity (simulated; no real changes to the system).

- **Network Simulation**  
  Simulates scanning of open ports on a system in a safe way for demonstration purposes.

- **In-Memory Execution Simulation**  
  Demonstrates code execution in memory using PowerShell or Python constructs without
   affecting the system.

- **Logging**  
  Records each stage and the results of simulated operations in `simulation_log.txt`.
